# MakeChangeProject

## Project description
### The Make Change program take prpmpts user for the amount of money owed for something and then prompts user for amount of money paid. The program then figures out how much change is needed (if any) using the largest bill and coin denominations.

## Lessons Learned
### I struggled most with getting the modulus operator to round correctly to maintain accuracy. I fixed this by consistently rounding the answer to two decimal places after using the modulus operator to solve the amount of coins needed in change.
